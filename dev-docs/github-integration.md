# GitHub-Based Task Management

## Overview

Instead of maintaining a separate database for tasks, Taskhub leverages GitHub's infrastructure for task storage and management. This approach provides several immediate benefits while reducing implementation complexity.

## Core Concept

### Organization Structure
- When a user (e.g., `username`) starts using Taskhub, an organization named `username-taskhub` is automatically created
- This organization serves as the user's personal task repository
- Example: User `crimson206` → Organization `crimson206-taskhub`

### Benefits

1. **Native Version Control**
   - Automatic version history through Git
   - Branch-based development
   - Conflict resolution built-in

2. **Collaboration Features**
   - Pull requests for task improvements
   - Issue tracking
   - Fork & merge workflow
   - Code review process

3. **Infrastructure Advantages**
   - No need for custom database
   - Reliable hosting
   - Built-in backup
   - Access control management

4. **Platform Flexibility**
   - Easy migration path to Gitea/GitLab
   - Self-hosted option available
   - Platform-agnostic design

## Implementation Impact

### Simplified Architecture
- Remove need for custom database
- Utilize GitHub API instead of custom backend
- Focus on Git operations rather than data storage

### Future Extensions
- Support for multiple Git platforms
  - GitHub (default)
  - GitLab
  - Gitea
  - Custom Git servers

### Security & Access
- Leverage GitHub's authentication
- Organization-level permissions
- Repository visibility controls

## Migration & Backup
- Tasks are just Git repositories
- Easy to backup (git clone)
- Simple to transfer between platforms
- No vendor lock-in

## Development Workflow
1. User creates new task → Creates new repository in their organization
2. Task updates → Git commits
3. Task sharing → Pull requests
4. Task versioning → Git tags and releases

This approach significantly reduces the need for custom infrastructure while providing enterprise-grade collaboration features through GitHub's platform.
